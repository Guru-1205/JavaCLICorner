# 📚 Java CLI Corner

Welcome to **Java CLI Corner**! This repository is a collection of Java terminal-based applications designed to help you with application coding and long coding for interview preparation. Each application leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to provide robust and efficient solutions.

## 🚀 Features

- **🖥️ Terminal-Based Applications**: All programs run directly in the terminal, making them lightweight and easy to use.
- **💡 OOP Concepts**: Each application is built using core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **📝 Interview Preparation**: Focus on common coding patterns and problems often encountered in technical interviews.
- **💼 Application Coding**: Practical coding examples to improve your problem-solving skills.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `📁 FarmerRetailerAuction/`: An application simulating a farmer-retailer auction system.
- `📁 LiftSchedulingApp/`: A lift management system that handles multiple lifts, user inputs for floors, and maintenance schedules.
- `📁 authenticationUsingFileClass/`: An authentication system using Java's File class.
- `📁 authenticationUsingFileTextSeparated/`: An authentication system with text-separated files.
- `📁 crudOperations/`: Basic CRUD operations for managing data.

## 📜 Applications

### 1. 🧑‍🌾 Farmer Retailer Auction
A terminal-based application simulating an auction system where farmers and retailers can interact.

### 2. 🏢 Lift Scheduling App
A terminal-based lift management system that handles multiple lifts, user inputs for floors, and maintenance schedules. Implements a HashMap to track lift details and save/load states from a file.

### 3. 🔐 Authentication Using File Class
An authentication system using Java's File class to handle user credentials and login operations.

### 4. 🔏 Authentication Using File Text Separated
An authentication system where user data is stored in text-separated files for easy management and retrieval.

### 5. 🛠️ CRUD Operations
Basic CRUD operations to demonstrate data management through Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities.
